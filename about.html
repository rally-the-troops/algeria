"Algeria: The War of Independence 1954-1962" is a 2-player wargame simulating
the conflict between the FLN Arab nationalist guerrillas and the French
government from 1954 to 1962. During the game, the FLN player tries to erode
the authority of the French colonial authorities and replace their governing
structures with his own, to the point that Algeria makes the transition from
being the 10th department of France to national independence.
